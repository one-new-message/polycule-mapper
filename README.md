# polycule-mapper
This is a web application for tracking and mapping relationships within polycules. It includes limited support for plural systems which, like the rest of the application, is a work in progress.

# Getting Started
The `polycule-mapper` interface should hopefully be intuitive. This is how to use it:

## People
Begin by adding people. When adding someone, you must specify a name and pronouns. Each of these is just a string; you can, for instance, use "ask" or "N/A" for pronouns.

Once a person has been added, they will appear in the table and can be clicked to view and edit more information. This includes the person's id, name, pronouns, systems, polycules, time zone, Twitter handle, and partners.

## Systems
This tab functions in largely the same way as the People tab. Click the name of a system to edit it. The system's name and members can be edited here.

## Polycules
This tab functions just like the Systems tab. Click the name of a polycule to edit it. The polycules's name and members can be edited here.

# Work In Progress
This application is very much a work in progress and is still missing some basic features like the ability to delete people, systems, or polycules once added. The map has also not yet been added.
